      "description": "The Great Indoors is an audio editing/soundscape production workshop meant to give participants an opportunity to (re)discover the interior spaces we occupy during the pandemic.This collaborative, participatory workshop will encourage sonic connections between physically distanced participants. By sharing our acoustic spaces, we can find commonality between each other and create a space for empathy and care.Over the course of this 90-minute workshop, workshop participants will walk through creating soundscapes from our indoor sonic environment. Starting with a brief presentation on sonic encounter, participants will be invited to explore their homes/apartments to record sounds with their phones/recording devices. The second portion of the workshop will involve a short overview on how to compose soundscapes in Audacity, an open-source audio editing software. Participants will upload their recordings to a shared drive (Dropbox/Google Drive) and will have time to put together a soundscape with everyone’s recordings. At the end of the workshop, we will share our soundscapes together.",

      "description": "In the grand scale of human-animal companionship, cats have only recently been considered domesticated pets. There's still much to learn about our feline friends and the spaces we share with them. Be sure to join us for a special two-part workshop, as Dr. Margie Scherk helps us better understand how we can help our cats flourish.\n Keeping cats indoors is considered to be the responsible way to keep a cat safe. An indoor cat won’t be hit by a car, killed by a predator, get into fights and is at a lower risk for some infectious diseases. Right? But what if there are dangers associated with this lifestyle? What if we are, inadvertently causing illness and distress? What preventive health and behavioral needs do these individuals have? This presentation will look at both sides and how to optimize the indoor life for all cats.\n There are many beliefs about cats that are untrue. Many are about how best to care for cats (recognizing sickness, preventive health care needs of indoor housed cats, optimal age for spaying or castration, what to feed cats). Others are about the people they live with (how to feed cats, teaching cats, what purring means, pregnancy and toxoplasmosis)",

      "description": "TRemotely guided walks are audio-guided using the Zoom app and can be experienced in a space as little as 200 square feet, and may take place in your backyard or a nearby natural area. You may also choose to experience this from indoors near a window to the outdoors. To bring yourself closer to nature, you might like to have a few natural elements such a rock, a shell, a feather, or a houseplant. These walks are more of a pulsing walk than a linear walk. You can choose a base location and experience each part of the walk in that area.\n Forest Therapy walks begin with slowing down and moving into your senses. Throughout the walk, you will be offered unique opportunities, called “invitations”, to mindfully interact and connect with the landscape around you. Invitations encourage presence, connection, wonder, tranquility, and a sense of union with nature. Walks typically conclude with a ceremony of sharing tea so please bring an insulated mug of a tea to enjoy. There will be optional opportunities to share and reflect on your experiences throughout the walk.",

      "description": "Throughout the Covid 19 pandemic estranged students have been struggling even more than usual with feelings of isolation and loneliness. Our first survey during the March 2020 lockdown found that 55% of HE students without family support said they were particularly worried about feeling lonely. The most recent survey in January 21 led by Unite Foundation showed that 27% of respondents are still lacking enough social interaction. Even if campuses are able to start opening up again after Easter and students can start to reconnect with their peers and their institutions, we know that loneliness and isolation is one of the main issues estranged students are always having to cope with.\n In this virtual 'Learning From Each Other' session we want to explore what universities and colleges can do to alleviate loneliness among estranged students who haven't been able to return to a family home during periods of lockdown but also looking ahead beyond the restrictions of the pandemic. Most of these students have no emotional support from family so look to their friends and often their institutions for support, especially in times of crisis.",

This winter and spring, New College students and Dragonfly Poetry Café students have embarked on an extraordinary correspondence in which they create characters, are assigned each other’s characters as pen pals, and exchange letters from their characters’ point of view. Curious? Confused? Join us to learn more about how these students are using their creativity as a catalyst for connection in disconnecting times. The event will feature Dr. Carr and Joanna Fox in conversation about their collaboration, and short readings by New College students who were part of this extraordinary correspondence.
